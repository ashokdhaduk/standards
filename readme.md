PGS Standards
=============

These standards are exactly the same as [PHP-FIG] PSR standards, with two differencies:

- you MAY use tabs for indenting
- you MAY write PHP constants `TRUE`, `FALSE`, and `NULL` in upper case

Basically, PGS standards are suitable for all PHP developers who want to be compliant
with well-known standards from the PHP-FIG, but are not interested in whitespace holy wars.

What standards are we talking about?
------------------------------------

- [PSR-0](accepted/PSR-0.md) - Autoloading Standard
- [PSR-1](accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md) - Basic Coding Standard
- [PGS-2](accepted/PGS-2-coding-style-guide.md) - Coding Style Guide, replaces PSR-2
- [PSR-4](accepted/PSR-4-autoloader.md) - Improved Autoloader


Rationale
---------

Some people like tabs, some like spaces. The 30 % of PHP projects use tabs. We
respect freedom to choice, especially when unsignificant whitespace can be converted
automatically, for example using Git:

```
git config --global filter.tabspace.smudge 'unexpand --tabs=4 --first-only'
git config --global filter.tabspace.clean 'expand --tabs=4 --initial'
```

(You should also configure Git to [convert line endings](https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings).)

Once chosen character for indentation is difficult to change, especially for bigger
projects, because change will make harder to deal with Git history and existing pull requests.

Therefore standard [PGS-2](accepted/PGS-2-coding-style-guide.md) in comparsion to
the PSR-2 allows using tabs for indentation.

---

Whole [PHP documentation uses](http://php.net/manual/en/types.comparisons.php)
constants `TRUE`, `FALSE` and `NULL` written in upper letters. PSR-1 itself
states that constants MUST be in upper cases. Therefore PGS-2 allows in comparsion
to the PSR-2 to write them in upper cases too.

---

Using tabs or capital letters is matter of your choice. But you MUST use the same
style consistently across all files in whole Vendor namespace.
